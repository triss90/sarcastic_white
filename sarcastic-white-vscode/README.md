# Sarcastic White Theme

**Sarcastic White** is an extension for VS Code that changes the original appearance to a dark blue-ish look and feel.

We've created the theme with a clean and uncluttered design pattern in mind, to achieve optimal focus and readability for code, syntax highlighting and UI components.
